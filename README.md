# Breast_cancer_Detection
Breast Cancer is a Type of tumour That’s Occurs in the Tissues of the Breast. It is most common type of cancer found in women around the world and it is among the Leading Causes of Deaths in women. However, if cancer is detected early and treated properly, it is possible to be cured of the condition. Early detection of breast cancer can dramatically improve the prognosis and chances of survival by allowing patients to receive timely clinical therapy. Furthermore, precise benign tumor classification can help patients avoid unneeded treatment. In this Project Presents Convolution Neural Networks used   for Image dataset and K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes algorithm being used for numerical dataset, whose features are obtained from digitized image of breast mass, as to forecast and analyze cancer databases in order to improve accuracy .The dataset will be analyzed, evaluated, and model is trained as part of the process. Finally, both image and numerical test data will be used for prediction.
